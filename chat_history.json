People may avoid engaging with processes that are unclear or overly complex. This phenomenon has been studied in a variety of contexts, such as when people were asked to pick a black ball from an urn where the probabilities of the other one were unknown, or when people were asked to wait for a doctor's appointment with either a specific, realistic waiting time or were told they only had to wait 10 minutes and were then periodically updated that it would be 10 minutes longer. Additionally, people's perceptions and judgements can be influenced by a variety of informational signals, such as when people were asked to bid on items in an auction and were first asked to write down the last 2 digits of their social security number, or when a firefighting unit in the US informed householders that they ideally need 5 smoke alarms in their house. Finally, people often mentally create a special \u201cmoney jar\u201d that is set aside for a holiday, while still carrying substantial credit card debt, and this special fund is treated differently from the money used to pay off debt, even though it\u2019s objectively exactly the same."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the psychology behind Ambiguity Aversion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nThe psychology behind Ambiguity Aversion is that people have a preference for risks that are associated with known probabilities. People are more likely to complete a process or task if their expectations are managed appropriately, and they tend to avoid decisions where the choices and commitments are ambiguous. This is because when faced with uncertainty, people may become overwhelmed and avoid engaging with the process. Additionally, people's perceptions and judgements can be influenced by a variety of informational signals, such as the first piece of information they are presented with, even if it is irrelevant to the decision.

He was the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. He was a humanist, universalist internationalist, and strident anti-nationalist who denounced the Raj and advocated independence from Britain. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa. \n\nTagore was born in the Jorasanko mansion in Calcutta, India to parents Debendranath Tagore (1817\u20131905) and Sarada Devi (1830\u20131875). He wrote poetry as an eight-year-old and released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhanusi?ha (\"Sun Lion\") at age sixteen. He graduated to his first short stories and dramas\u2014and the aegis of his birth name\u2014by 1877. \n\nTagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His works include Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced), and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World). He is also known for his novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: the Republic of India's Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh's Amar Shonar Bangla. \n\nTagore interacted with Henri Bergson, Albert Einstein, Robert Frost, Thomas Mann, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells and Romain Rolland. He wrote his Oxford Hibbert Lectures and spoke at the annual London Quaker meet. He visited Agha Khan III, stayed at Dartington Hall, toured Denmark, Switzerland, and Germany, and went on into the Soviet Union. He also visited Persia and Iraq (in 1932) and Sri Lanka (in 1933)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Compose a poem about summer based on the context of the poems that you have been trained on written by Rabindranath Tagore, in the style of Tagore himself"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nSummer's Splendor\n\nThe summer has come with its warmth and its light,\nBringing joy and beauty to the day and the night.\nThe sun shines brightly in the sky so blue,\nIlluminating the world with its golden hue.\n\nThe birds sing sweetly in the trees so tall,\nTheir melodies ringing out for one and all.\nThe flowers bloom in the meadows so green,\nTheir beauty and fragrance a sight to be seen.\n\nThe bees buzz around in the flowering grove,\nTheir minstrelsy a joy to behold and approve.\nThe breeze blows gently through the air,\nCarrying the scent of summer everywhere.\n\nThe days are long and the nights are short,\nThe summer's splendor a wondrous sort.\nThe heat of the sun and the cool of the night,\nBringing joy and peace in its wondrous light."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a few lines from your favuorite poem of Tagore?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n\"Here is the same sky,\" she said,\n\"only free from the fencing hills,--\nthis is the same stream grown into a\nriver,--the same earth widened into\na plain.\" \n\nO woman, thou camest for a moment to my side and touched me with the great\nmystery of the woman that there is in the heart of creation\u2014she who ever gives\nback to God his own outflow of sweetness; who is the eternal love and beauty\nand youth; who dances in bubbling streams and sings in the morning light; who\nwith heaving waves suckles the thirsty earth and whose mercy melts in rain; in\nwhom the eternal one breaks in two in joy that can contain itself no more and\noverflows in the pain of love."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me something interesting about Tagore's childhood?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nTagore was raised mostly by servants and his home hosted the publication of literary magazines.
